<p>Hi Everyone! I graduated with a bachelor's in math (minor in secondary education) from Saint Mary's College of Notre Dame in 2015 </b> and am in my 3rd year 
teaching math at LaSalle-Peru High School in the northern half of central IL :).  This is my second semester working towards my master's in Technology in Schools.  
Along with teaching, I have also coached the scholastic bowl and math teams and volunteer with HOBY.  HOBY is an international organization that hosts 
leadership seminars for high school sophomores every summer, and for the past 3 years I have worked as the Director of Ambassador Relations and Registration.</p> 

<p>I have never used Photoshop, and actually, until last semester when I started working towards my degree, I wasn't a large user of technology in general.  
Our district is 1:1, but most teachers utilized that as access to online textbooks for students and that was it.  Since last fall I have learned so many new 
and exciting ways to incorporate technology and I am excited to learn even more from this class and all of you!</p>
