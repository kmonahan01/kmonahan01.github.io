            I chose to film one of my friends, her son, and them working with essential oils 
            since I have recently gotten into them as well.  They really work!  Once my friend came over, 
            I had my phone out and just casually filmed/took photos whenever I felt like I could potentially 
            use something.  Later that night, my husband helped me put the photos and videos onto his computer.
            From there I was able to click/drag/order the motion sequences and stills into the order I wanted.
            I was able to next record my own voiceover easily (thanks to Audacity!) To lower the audio 
            in the motion sequences, I highlighted the sequence and clicked on the sound icon above the preview window, 
            then selected the option to lower the volume.  I added a title and credits page by clicking on the background options.
            and a dissolve/cross-fade to the last still by clicking on the transition options.  Lastly, I adjusted the time by 
            highlighting the portion I wanted and dragging left or right.
