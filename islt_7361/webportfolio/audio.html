        <h2>Audio Project</h2>
        <h3>Project Requirements</h3>
        <ol><li>Your audio file must be between 30-60 seconds long
            <li>The file must contain at least 2 tracks:
                <ul><li>1 track must be background music
                    <li>1 track must be recorded voice. <br>
                        The two overlapping audio tracks should be mixed to play 
                        simultaneously at balanced levels so they can be heard comfortably
                    </ul>
            <li>Music must gradually and noticeably fade the volume down as voice track enters
            <li>Music must fade to 0 volume at end over at least a 2 second span
            <li>A voice track must contain 1 filter or effect that is obvious to the listener (in addition to fading)
            </ol>

        <p>Since I am a math teacher so I read a poem that is on a poster in my classroom (Maths a Challenge by Shreeya Katyal) 
            and paired it with an instrumental soundtrack I use when students are working quietly.  I have never used Audacity before--
            it was surprisingly quite user friendly!  Following the steps provided within the tutorial for Recording and Editing, I recorded my narration.
            Once I stopped the recording, I used the “select” cursor to highlight the small amount of recording at the beginning and the end that I didn’t want to keep and deleted them.
            I also used the “time shift tool” to move the narration into a spot where the background music would play for a few seconds before my voice entered.
            Last, I needed an effect for my voice.  I knew that last statement in the poem was the most important one, and I wanted that to stick with whoever was listening.  
            I highlighted that last statement and just played in the “effect” column until I found the “reverb” option and loved it.
