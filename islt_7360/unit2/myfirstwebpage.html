<h1>My H1 is my title</h1>

<p>Hello, Class! My name is Kaitie. This is block is surrounded by 
paragraph tags. Paragraphs are a block <br> level element.</p>

<p>However, some tags are inline, meaning that they don't create a new 
block of text, but they state that there <br> is a meaning change. For example, 
<b>this text is emphasized by making it bold</b>. Sometimes we may <br> choose 
to emphasize other text by <i>italicizing it</i> or <u>underlining it</u>.</p>

<h2>My Lists. This is an H2 header; it is a subheading underneath H1.</h2>

<h3>Unordered Lists (h3 heading)</h3>

We can also make lists. Here is an example of a bulleted (unordered) grocery list:
<ul>
    <li>Apples
    <li>Milk
    <li>Lettuce
    <li>Cereal
        </ul>

<h3>Ordered Lists (h3 heading)</h3>

Or sometimes I want to make a list, but it is numbered (ordered list) instead. For example, 
the first three <br> things I need to do today, in order are:
<ol>
    <li>Brush teeth
    <li>Eat breakfast
    <li>Take child to preschool
        </ol>

<h2>Links (h2 heading)</h2>

I can also link to different things. For example, I can go to <a href="http://google.com">Google.com</a> by going to <a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a>. <br> 
This is an absolute link because it has the entire URL listed there. If I were to link to something locally on <br>
my server relative to this file, it would be a relative link. But we'll link to that type of page next time.

<h2>Inline styling with colors (h2 heading)</h2>

I can also color text using inline styling, but for the most part it is really best to use styling that is done in <br>
the header or using an external stylesheet. But we will worry about doing that next time. Here I am <br>
making text <span style="color: #008000;">green</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">red</span>, or <span style="color: #0000ff;">blue</span>. It is really easy to insert a new color. There are lots of places to look for <br> 
colors. You could go here <a href="http://www.color-hex.com/">color-hex.com</a>, for example, at <a href="http://www.color-hex.com/">http://www.color-hex.com/</a>. 

<p>This is all for now. I made my first page!</p>
