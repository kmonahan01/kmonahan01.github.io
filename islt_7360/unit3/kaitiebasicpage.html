<p> I have officially created my first webpage and it was so much easier than I thought!  Thinking about possible ideas for my final website,  I am considering two different ideas:

<h3><i>Project Idea #1</i></h3>

<b><u>Mrs. Monahan's Math Classroom Website</u></b>

<p>While the district I work in is very Google Classroom heavy, I believe there are more benefits to having a personalized classroom website:</p>
<ul>
    <li> After learning parents and guardians are unable to access Google Classroom, they will be able to access classroom information better.
    <li> The site will be more personable and geared toward my students and their families.
    <li> I could incorporate coding and web development into lessons throughout the year.
        </ul>

<h3><i>Project Idea #2</i></h3>

<b><u>HOBY ILCS Website</u></b>

<p>HOBY, or Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership, is an international organzation in which I hold the role of Director of Registration and Ambassador Relations
at our ILCS site.  There are two seminar sites in Illinois, and while each site has their own social media sites, as well as direct volunteers and participants to the organization site, it might be nice for our location to have it's own place
for calendar events, FAQ, and contact information specifically for Illinois Central-South (ILCS).</p>

<p> As you can see from their website, <a href="http://HOBY.org">HOBY.org</a>, HOBY, 
<blockquote><i>empowers high school sophomores to develop their leadership talents to become the leaders of their community. The seminar curriculm is based on the Social Change Model of Leadership
             and develops leadership from three perspectives: Personal Leadership, Group Leadership, and Leadership for Society. </i>
</blockquote>

<p>While the international site is indeed user friendly, this specific location website would ease the reader's ability to find information without having to go through more than three links to find what
    they are searching for.</p>
