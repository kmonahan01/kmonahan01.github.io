<h3> Participants:</h3>

<p>Alyssa Wachsman and Jessica Henke were two fellow <b>classmates</b> in my Introduction to Web Development class.  I have seen, and am very impressed, by both of their work, so I was 
   ecstatic when they commented on my project with comments about parts of my site they liked as well as ideas about what I could change.  Both ladies have been learning along with
   me about different characteristics that make webpages accessible to all visitors and I knew they would offer great advice if I had missed anything.</p>

<p>Kassadee Ifft is one of my friends who had offered to take a look at my website.  She is a 20 year old sophomore at the University of Notre Dame, and has gone through the HOBY program as 
   an ambassador as well as many years as a volunteer for the organization.  As someone who has seen both ends of the organization (participant and volunteer) I knew she would offer feedback 
   that would be greatly beneficial in terms of layout, organization, and content.  While evaluating, Kassadee was using an Acer Inspire with Windows running Intel Core i5.  She opened my website
   using Mozilla Firefox and was connected to her dorm's internet system.</p>

<p>Next, I had my sister, Kassidy Maierhofer, evaluate my website.  Kassie has also gone through the HOBY program as an ambassador and worked as a volunteer in the past.  Kassie is a 21 year old
   sophomore at Murray State University in Kentucky.  Similar to Kassadee, I knew Kassie would offer thorough advice and some of the best constructive criticism I could get on my site since she has 
   seen both ends of the organization and knows exactly what ambassadors and volunteers are in need of and looking for.  Being my sister as well I knew she would have no problem telling me what I
   was doing wrong.  While evaluating, Kassie was using a Dell desktop running Windows 7, Intel Core i5.  She opened the site in Google Chrome and was connected to the internet using a cable modem. </p>

<p>My last evaluator was one of the school guidance counselors that I work with, Ryan Duffy.  Ryan is the guidance counselor in charge of interviewing and choosing which sophomores attend the seminar
   from our high school.  I knew he would be perfect to offer input on how I could potentially make my website more user friendly and helpful for counselors.  While evaluating, Ryan was using a Macbook
   Air running OSX El Capitan with Intel Core i5, 1.6 GHz, 8 GB RAM, 1 processor, and 2 cores.  He opened my website using Google Chrome version 61 and was connected to the internet through his residential
   Wi-Fi (Xfinity 5G cable modem). </p>

<p>Overall, my evaluators seemed to really enjoy the website all offering minimal issues that need to be addressed.  In terms of design and development, one of my users suggested adding a "Frequently Asked
   Questions" page and stated that the yellow I had chosed seemed to be a bit much.  Two evaluators, a user and one of my classmates, commented on the homepage--stating it seemed distorted and busy; their 
   eyes were pulled to both the navigation and the calendar of events. I do not currently have the details and size of the pictures listed and 2 of my 4 evaluators commented on that as well.</p>

<p>All evaluators were content with the content.  A few noted that they could see users with any type of relationship to or with HOBY repeatedly revisiting the website for information, however, if a user has
   no need for HOBY details, they would more than likely not return to this site. Everyone noted that the website held full credibility as well.</p>

<p>In the end, my website was tested in Chrome and Firefox on three different computers with different operating systems and versions.  There were no loading issues and all said they could not wait until the
   site was finished for them to see and use it in their work with HOBY.</p>

<h3>Recommended/Planned Changes:</h3>

Based on the feedback I received, there really are no major changes.<br>

<p>In terms of <b>design and development</b>, all three users commented on my background color choice, however two of the three both said they like it.  The third one, Kassadee, said there were too many shades of yellow,
   however, I used the same shade all the way through.  I am going to see if I can find a way to differentiate between the navigation and the calendar of events though as Alyssa and Jessica both mentioned.  The more
   I look at it, the more I see how a visitor's eyes would want to go immediately to both places.  My sister, Kassie, also mentioned the homepage appears distorted.  I am going to speak with her a little bit more to find
   out in what way or where exactly the distortment happens to see if I can change that at all.  If it is where I am thinking, I am going to move the center picture a little bit.  I am also going to try and put captions on
   the pictures to state their size.</p>

<p>One edit, or rather, add-in, I would like to make in terms of <b>content</b> would be an idea from Ryan (the guidance counselor).  He mentioned putting a past schedule of events while on site during the seminar on the website
   for visitors to see.  This, along with the FAQ page that Kassadee mentioned would probably eliviate even more questions from ambassadors, parents, and even counselors.</p>

<h3>Reflections on Evaluation Process:</h3>

<p>I actually struggled at first with the evaluation process.  Since I had surveyed all of the directors and a couple other volunteers for the organization to see what I should put on the website for my design document, I was hoping 
   to have some of the same people evaluate the site to make sure I was doing what they had in mind.  However, it was appearing to be quite difficult to get any of the directors to respond to me this past week.  Then I remembered that
   I have other stakeholders in the website, as well as other people who would be more than happy to critique me.  Thus, I had my sister and a guidance counselor look over the website.  I also was getting a little worried when
   the first two (Kassadee and Kassie) had returned their forms with 4s and 5s, not leaving me with much to edit or change.  However, when Ryan returned his, I knew I had a decent pilot created for my website.</p>

<p>In general, I am a little weird and do enjoy getting constructive criticism.  It gives me a little bit of confidence back that I do actually know what I am doing and lets me know different ways I am able to make myself better.  Being 
   able to go through this process now was extremely useful and eased some of my stress over my website knowing that there wasn't that much I need to change.  I will be putting up a past seminar schedule as well as stating the size of pictures
   on the site.  I am super excited to continue to build my site and can't wait to see how
   it ends up!</p>
