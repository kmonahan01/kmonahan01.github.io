        <img src="chrisbowers.jpg" align="right" width="200" height="200" alt="ILCS 2017"> <p>Chris Bowers' life is dedicated to the positive influence and motivation of students through
        his sense of humor.  He is a dynamic storyteller and his hilarious tales serve to emphasize the lessons he is trying to convey.</p>
        
        <p>Chris has appeared as the keynote speaker for Student Council, Key Club, HOBY, BPA, FBLA, DECCA, 4-H, FCCLA, PRIDE and Student Journalism state conferences.  He was also accepted
            as one of only 48 speakers in the prestigous Jostens Speakers Bureau.  He has spoken in 34 states and reaches thousands of high school and middle school students a year.</p>
        
        <p>Chris speaks to audiences about the power they have to take risks and to have confidence in themselves.  He uses humor to build camaraderie with students so he can encourage them
            to overcome their fear of failure and fear of what others think of them.  He emphasizes positive ways of dealing with frustration and conflict resolution.  Audiences find themselves
            laughing along as he tells his own personal stories to get his points across.  His presenations are dynamic and his enthusiasm is contagious.</p>
