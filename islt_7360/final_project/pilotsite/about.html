            <h2>What is HOBY?</h2>
            <h3>History of HOBY</h3>
                <p>In the summer of 1958, while actor Hugh O'Brian was in the middle of his career of playing Wyatt Earp, he received an invitation from 1952 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Dr. Albert Schweitzer,
                   welcoming him to French Equitorial Africa at any time.  Within two weeks, O'Brian was on his way to Africa where he spent nine days at the clinic founded by Dr. Schweitzer.  While he was 
                   there, his time was spent helping Dr. Schweitzer care for patients, many of whom had contracted Leprosy.  Each night, Schweitzer would share his stories with O'Brian.  He voiced concern
                   about the global peace prospects and thought the United States should take a leadership role in achieving peace.  O'Brian took Dr. Schweitzer's concerns back to the United States with him
                   and two weeks later had developed a prototype for what would be the first Hugh O'Brian Youth (HOBY) seminar. </p>
            
            <h3>History of HOBY ILCS</h3>
                <p>Designed to help high school sophomores to recognize their leadership talents and apply them to become effective, ethical leaders in their home, school, workplace and community, 
                   HOBY Illinois has been changing the lives of high school students for over 40 years.  Thirteen years ago, the state broke in to two different seminar locations, North (north of Interstate 80) 
                   and Central-South (Interstate 80/south), to better accommodate our ambassadors.  HOBY Illinois Central-South 2018 will take place June 14-17, where student ambassadors will participate 
                   in hands-on leadership activities, meet leaders in their state, and explore their own personal leadership skills while learning how to lead others and make a positive impact in their community.
                   We are expecting over 170 ambassadors from across the ILCS area this year!</p>
