            <h2>Donors</h2>
       <p> A four day HOBY seminar costs approximately $32,000 to hold and run.  Being a non-profit organization, 100% of our funds are fundraised or donated.  All of those involved 
           in the seminar (directors, staff, and ambassadors) greatly appreciate all that our donors do for us.  HOBY gives it's ambassadors and alumni lifelong friends, opportunities, and 
           confidence to change their world a little bit at a time.  Please consider donating to HOBY ILCS.  If a junior staff member has not contacted you and you would still like to donate,
          please contact one of the directors listed on the <i>Contact Us</i> page to donate.</p>
       
       <p>Please look back in December for updated costs and lists of our Bronze, Silver, and Gold Donors for the upcoming 2018 seminar!</p>
