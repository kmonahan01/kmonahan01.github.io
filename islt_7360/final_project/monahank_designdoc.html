<h2> Purpose:</h2>

This website will be for the Hugh O’Brian Youth (HOBY) Leadership organization, Illinois Central-South (Interstate 80 and south) location.  While there is currently a website,<a href="http://HOBY.org">HOBY.org</a>, that site links you to the 
national information with small bits of information about the international organization.  There is also an HOBY Illinois site, <a href="http://www.hobyillinois.org">hobyillinois.org</a>, but, that site is not entirely user friendly and specified to those within 
the ILCS area as there is also a seminar held in Illinois North.  The goals of the website would be to give the ambassadors (sophomores in high school who attend the HOBY seminar) and the volunteers a place specifically for them to go that holds 
important dates and files.  As Director of Registration and Ambassador Relations for the organization, it is my job to send out the registration forms which include the medical forms, packing lists, maps, etc.  Of the nearly 300 registration 
forms I send out, approximately half email me back saying they are unable to find, or misplaced, the packing list, map, or other information.  With this site, I would simply be able to provide a link and all the information they would need would 
be at their fingertips.

<h2>Audience:</h2>

My target audience would be 15 years old and older, both male and female.  Any student (ambassador), parent/guardian, guidance counselor, school administration member, or site volunteer would have access and be encouraged to utilize the site.  Due to these 
characteristics, the level of internet usage/computer skills, prior knowledge, and experience with HOBY would range greatly.  As previously mentioned, this site would strictly be for those who live right off Interstate 80 all the way to the southern tip of Illinois.

<h2>Needs Assessment:</h2>

While considering the needs assessment for this site, I spoke with six people who currently hold or had held a role in the HOBY ILCS seminar.  These people range from (past) ambassadors, volunteer staff, and director positions.  Overall, the participants wish to see this
website have a professional appearance and not become a social media platform similar to accounts the organization already has.  They want this site to be the one place to point all of our future ambassadors, families, and conselors for information.  Such things to be included
on the website would be the packing lists, printable mandatory forms, links to FAQs, photos, testimonials from the previous year, notable alumni, and more.

<p><b>Questions asked:</b><br>

<i>What information on this website would be useful to you?  What would you for sure want on the website? </i>
<ul>
    <li>A timeline of upcoming events
    <li>Separate resource sections for ambassadors and volunteers
    <li>Place to donate to ILCS
    <li>Featured speakers page to build excitement
    <li>Potential advertisement area for colleges that is tied to our college fair
    <li>Countdown to the seminar
        </ul>

<i>What would you not want on the website?</i>
<ul>
    <li>Not another social media platform
    <li>Too much/redundant material
    <li>Outdated information
        </ul>

<i>How often do you foresee the website being used?</i>
<ul>
    <li>All agreed that the website would be used near daily by ambassadors, parents/guardians, counselors, and volunteers.
    </ul>

<i>How would you use ths website?</i>
<ul>
    <li>To assist staff and ambassadors with the requirement and registration process
    <li>As the informational hub about the seminar.  It would be more for ambassador use than anyone else.
        </ul>

<i>Is there anything else you want me to know or take into account?</i>
<ul>
    <li>Potentially have some sections of the website password protected. (This is something I am not sure will happen right away, but am willing to figure out a way!)
        </ul>
<b>Use Cases:</b>
<ol>
    <li>In the heart of HOBY season (the spring semester of a school year), our junior staff members are called on to go out into their communities and get as many donations 
        as possible.  Generally, it takes $32,000 to hold a four-day HOBY seminar, so many volunteers simply give their time by working on donations and/or grant writing.  
        Our junior staff members range in age from 17 to 20 and are usually incredibly busy with their own school work and extra curriculars.  By having an area on this website 
        specifically meant for donations, it would greatly help the staff have a specific area to go to log any donations or send potential donors to.
    <li>During the month of April, I send out over 300 detailed registration forms that students and their families must fill out before arriving on site for the seminar.  
        Within those forms, there is a packing list, medication form, and a list of frequently asked questions.  For many different reasons, people lose, forget, or can’t seem 
        to find these attachments and I then end up remailing at least 200 individual people.  These forms could have a spot on the website for anyone to download, print, and 
        reference at any time.
    <li>Once the ambassadors successfully complete a HOBY seminar, we challenge them to go out and get 100 service hours.  I have spoken with many who struggle to come up with 
        ideas or locations to earn those hours.  This website would have a list of potential ideas, places, or people to connect with.
        </ol>

<b>Five Reference Websites:</b>

 Five websites that demonstrate either good or bad examples of what I am considering for my final design:
 <ul>
     <li>For a good layout and example of the "participate" button for volunteer options see this example here from the <a href="https://www.ffa.org">National FFA Organization</a>.
     <li>For an avoid layout please note this example from <a href="http://www.coolmath-games.com/">Cool Math</a>.  Here, the page is too busy and the use of a random layout.
     <li>For a good layout and content example, see <a href="http://www.theleaderinme.org/">here</a>.  This demonstrates how I foresee the banner of the HOBY ILCS site with similar 
        options, such as: resources, speakers, events, and more.
     <li>For an avoid content, consider the <a href="www.hobyillinois.org">HOBY Illinois site</a>.  While I envision the HOBY ILCS site similar in color scheme and style, the content provided on the ILCS site will be
         more relavant and updated.
     <li>For a navigation, content, and layout example,<a href="http://www.hoby.org.uk">this example</a> best matches what the HOBY ILCS webiste will be.
        </ul>

<h2>Content:</h2>

Based on the responsed I have received from ambassadors, volunteers, and directors, the content of my page, as of now, will be:
<ul>
    <li><u>About</u> A section dedicated to providing the reader with information based on the history, mission statement, and goals of HOBY.
    <li><u>Events</u> This section will strictly list any upcoming events or important dates for those within the HOBY ILCS location.  For example, 
                      registration form due dates, alumni picnics, staff application dates, and more.
    <li><u>Donors</u> This section will list information for donors as to where to send payment, what the levels of special donors are, where the
                      money is going and more.
    <li><u>Resources</u> This section will house all forms that are able to be downloaded and printed, as well as FAQs, staff and ambassador application
                          information, and more.
    <li><u>Speakers</u> This section will briefly introduce any speakers we have on site to increase excitement and inform all volunteers and ambassadors
                         who will be at the seminar.
    <li><u>Alumni</u> This section will be dedicated to our alumni.  This will have an alumni spotlight and list any upcoming alumni events.
    <li><u>Store</u> There is a HOBY store where people are able to purchase HOBY merchandise.  Information on that will be here.
    <li><u>Contact</u> This section will house all of the contact information for the directors and allow any site vistors to contact any of us.
        </ul>

<h2>Presentation of Information/Rationale of Organization:</h2>

Due to the content and nature of my website, it will be set to follow a heirarchical structure.
<ul>
    <li>My HOBY ILCS website will provide the audience with a sense of <i>consistency, flow, and professionalism</i> by containing:
    <ul>
        <li>The same banner/logo/menu bar at the top of each page
        <li>The same font type, color, and organization of each page
        <li>My email information at the bottom of each page
          </ul>
    <li>The <b>homepage</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Will provide links to the other eight sections
        <li>Will include a welcome statement and my contact information
        </ul>
    <li>The <b>subsequent pages</b>
        <ul>
            <li>As with the homepage, will provide a horizontal navigation across the top of the screen, should more links and information be needed.
            <li>Will keep information brief and to the point; viewers should not have to scroll more than three pages lengths to read information.
            </ul>
        </ul>

Potential content for my proposed pages include:
<ul>
    <li>The <u>About</u> page
        <ul>
            <li>This page will be have three different sections within it: History of HOBY, History of ILCS, and the mission statement.
            <li>It will have a vertical organization (for now), as there is not a terribly large amount of information here.
                </ul>
    <li>The <u>Events</u> page
        <ul>
            <li>This page will be divided into two columns that lists upcoming dates and locations for events in the HOBY ILCS location.
            <li>All information will be updated monthly, or as soon as new information is available.
                </ul>
    <li>The <u>Donors</u> page
        <ul>
            <li>This page will contain an area for donors to give and specify, if they wish, to what part of the seminar they are wanting to give towards.
            <li>There will be a running total of how much we have received in donations during that particular HOBY year (July 1-June 30).
            <li>There will also be a list of our bronze, silver, and gold donors.
                </ul>
    <li>The <u>Resources</u> page
        <ul>
            <li>Different applications, forms, lists, times, maps, etc will all be available here for viewers to view, download, and print.
            <li>Brief descriptions will be placed next to each item as to what each item is and which director/address the paperwork needs to be returned to
                if that is the case.
            <li>Emails for each HOBY ILCS Director will be listed here as well.
                </ul>
    <li>The <u>Speakers</u> page
        <ul>
            <li>This page will include short bios and pictures of our recent speakers.
            <li>It will also have a vertical organization to it as readers can scroll down to see past speakers.
            <li>Any speaker that has been a guest at our seminar more than 3 years ago will be removed from the page to make room for new speakers.
                </ul>
    <li>The <u>Alumni</u> page
        <ul>
            <li>This page will have a table-esque set up.
            <li>Alumni and their seminar years will be listed in separate boxes.
            <li>The top box will have an "Alumni Spotlight."
            <li>The bottom box will have all service opportunities that have been made aware to the group as well as a link to log any service hours.
                </ul>
    <li>The <u>Store</u> page
        <ul>
            <li>A link to and examples of merchandise from the HOBY store can be found on this page.
                </ul>
    <li>The <u>Contact</u> page
        <ul>
            <li>All contact information for all ILCS Directors will be found on this page.
            <li>Working email links will be included.
                </ul>
        </ul>


<h2>Media:</h2>

The international HOBY logo will appear on the homepage (pending permission from the corporate board), and proper acknowledgement will be given for the use
of that logo.  All other photos and videos shown on the website will be taken by the ambassadors, volunteers, and speakers.  They will all be optimized for 
web use and have a statement near each photo or video giving proper credit, as well as addition to the footer of each page stating that photos may only be 
reproduced and used with proper permission from the photographer.  As HOBY is insured as an educational body, we do also require ambassadors to fill 
out forms stating whether or not they want to appear in photos and videos on our social media sites; the same protocol will be followed here.

<h2>Color Scheme and Rationale:</h2>

Since this website is a HOBY site, I plan to use the international HOBY colors.  These are as close to the colors as I am going to be able to get while still 
using web safe colors.  I plan on using the lighter shades to be backgrounds that will hold much of the writing to ease the readability of the pages.  The darker 
colors will be used as banners, borders, and to make different aspects of my pages stand out better.  We use the color blue in HOBY since it It symbolizes trust, 
loyalty, wisdom, confidence, intelligence, faith, truth, and heaven. Blue is also considered beneficial to the mind and body.  The different shades of yellow or gold
represent illumination, love, compassion, courage, passion, magic, and wisdom.  Please note the background color of this page is also a HOBY color and will be seen
on my website as well.
